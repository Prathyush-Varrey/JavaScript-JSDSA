Time Complexity :
     Time complexity is used to measure the growth of execution time of an algorithm as the size of the input increases.

Example : Imagine   in a classroom of 100 students in which there is 100 rs note. Now you need to see that note but you don't know with which person the note is there.

Now you can to 3 things.
O(n^2) :  Go to a person and ask if he has the note if yes you get see the note. Also you ask this person about other 99 students if they have note so on until you get to see note

O(n) : You go to each and every person and ask if they have note or not.

O(n logn) : You divide class in different teams and ask for the not 
          right and left team and then do so on until you get the note
  

Space Complexity :Refers to the amout of the memory required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

Note : You'll come accross the term Auxiliary spacy very commonly in DSA. which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
